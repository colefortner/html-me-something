                <p>I love to learn and my college years have never really stopped.  I will always be taking a course
                    in something.  I'm kind of like Buster Bluth without the attachment to my mother.  The main college 
                    I went to was the Univerity of North Dakota (pictured above).  I have also taken courses at Washington 
                    University in St. Louis, University of Missour St. Louis, Universtiy of Minnesota Twin Cities among 
                    others.  I have degrees in Psychology and Nursing.  I learned Norwegain.

                <p>After moving around a bit, I moved back to St. Louis and fell into a job in Parks and Recreation Department.
                    It was a lot of fun in the beginning, but I stuck around far too long.  I tried LC a few years back, but my parents 
                    kept encountering health issues that required me to travel to Georgia so it didn't work out that time.  Once I heard 
                    that LC was going virtual, I reapplied and here I am.  It has allowed me to help my parents through this pandemic while 
                    moving forward with a career change into something that I really enjoy.

                <p>I have lived in socially conservative states all of my life.  Given the current political climate, and being queer, i would like
                    to put an end to that.  I would be glad to start my new career anywhere I can get my foot in the door, but ultimately
                    would like to live somewhere that is more open, accepting and that has a strong belief in science.  I am thinking the 
                    northeast, like Montreal, Burlington Vermont, Boston, NYC (pictured above in that order).
