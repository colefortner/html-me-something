                <p>I love to learn and my college years have never really stopped.  I will always be taking a course
                    in something.  I'm kind of like Buster Bluth without the attachment to my mother.  Here are some of the 
                    colleges I have attended.

                <p>After moving around a bit, I moved back to St. Louis and fell into a job in Parks and Recreation Department.
                    It was a lot of fun in the beginning, but I stuck around far too long.  I tried LC a few years back, but my parents 
                    kept encountering health issues that required me to travel to Georgia so it didn't work out that time.  Once I heard 
                    that LC was going virtual, I reapplied and here I am.  It has allowed me to help my parents through this pandemic while 
                    moving forward with a career change into something that I really enjoy

                <p>I have lived in socially conservative states all of my life and given the current political climate, i would like
                    to put an end to that.  I would be glad to start my new career anywhere I can get my foot in the door, but ultimately
                    would like to live somewhere that is more open, accepting and that has a strong belief in science.  I am thinking the 
                    northeast, like  a Vermont or Massachusetts.  Identifying as Queer so late in life is kind of tough when you have
                    spent a lifetime internalizing the negative views of those around you.  Even though things have gotten tons better
                    since I was a kid growing up in Missouri, I still would rather live in a place where I didn't feel the need to self-monitor at
                    at least until I grow more comfortable and actually have a support system in place.
